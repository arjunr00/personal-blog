Not about anything in specific, just in general.
I have opinions and thoughts and interests and likes and dislikes, and I like telling people about them.
So I figured, why not just write it all in one place?

This post is going to be my first (of hopefully more than one) dev diary.
As such, a lot of this is going to be very stream of consciousness, direct brain-to-fingers stuff.

## Naming Ceremony

I love to procrastinate on actually starting a project, so of course I needed to come up with what I want to call this.

The first word that came to my head is "blog", but I don't like it.
It implies consistency in some regard, thematically or structurally or what-have-you, but I don't intend on being consistent.
I might review a book, or rant about a pet peeve, or write a short story, or talk about something I've been interested lately---you get the idea.
This would be a place for all of that and more, so in the spirit of being inclusive, I decided to call it a Writing Thingy.

I actually did come up with a title for this Writing Thingy already.
Almost exactly a year ago at the time of writing*, I whipped up a design for this on Figma.

_Click to add title._
_musings of a man who can never make up his mind_

I'm pretty proud of it.
I'm very indecisive, you see, and so what better name for a Writing Thingy than the default title text on a new PowerPoint presentation?
Plus I get a little alliteration in the subtitle, as a treat.

Anyway, like I said, it's been a year since I made this design.
I suppose I should start actually building this thing.

## Enough Procrastinating

Keep in mind that I'm usually not much of a planner; I prefer to just wing things.
  [footnote] I believe in the writing community they call this "pantsing".
With that, let's jump right in.

I like to use personal projects as a means of learning new technologies.
In this case, I'm going to try use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a server-side rendering framework, for the first time.
  [footnote] Feel free to skip the techy bits.

#### Aside: What is Next.js?
